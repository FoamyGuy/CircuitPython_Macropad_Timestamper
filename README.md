# Circuitpython Timestamper
This device allows you to start a timer running at the press of a button. Then while the timer is running you can press a different button to paste the current timestamp into the active program on the PC that the Circuitpython device is plugged in to.

Helpful for easily typing timestamps during the the recording of videos and other media.

Submissions welcomed for improvements or ports to other devices or formfactors.
